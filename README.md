# stock-analysis
Project to analyze stocks
#Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to calculate the returns for 12 stocks, using the years 2017 and 2018. We previously created code to pull these values, but the goal was to create a code that could pull the data in a faster time frame. We refactored existing code with the code of improving it to run faster.

#Results

The result is that the refactored code does at a faster speed than the original code. Modifying the starter code in the situation did enhance the code. For 2017, the original code ran in 71571.05 seconds, compared to the refactored code, which ran in 0.09375 seconds. For 2018, the original code ran in 71734.95 seconds, compared to the refactored code, which ran in 0.1859375 seconds. In a situation with a large data set, finding ways to improve how fast a code run would be even more important.

#Summary

I believe there are more disadvantages with refactoring code. With refactored code, you have to go through a format that is already created and figure out where the issues are. This is more time consuming and challenging than creating code from scratch. If you are creating code from scratch, you are able to outline exactly what you want to accomplish, and write the code in between to fit those criteria. With refactored code, you are trying to work around code that may be formatted differently than how you would set it up, and you are trying to fix errors in that way. If you know what the goal is for the code, you can create to be more efficient from the very beginning. In this particular situation, since we were not working on a large data set, the faster run time did not have much of an impact, but for a larger project, running the refactored code would definitely be beneficial.
